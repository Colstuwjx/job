# job
Another easy-to-use job service written in golang

## Usage

harbor official doc was migrated to [here](https://github.com/Colstuwjx/job/blob/master/docs/README.md), you could also visit the [official doc](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/master/src/jobservice/README.md).

## Notice
The backbone of this repo is extracted from [harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor).

Inside [harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor) project, there is a very nicely written job scheduler for image replication, gc etc. However as it's not a self-contained application, I created this one. It applies the same LICENSE as [harbor](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor).
